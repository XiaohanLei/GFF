# GFF: Open-Vocabulary Grasping via Gaussian Force Field
Implementation of paper "Open-Vocabulary Grasping via Gaussian Force Field"

Current GFF implements a simplified version of only using partial point-cloud to generate 6-Dof poses, we'll add Language Embedded Gaussian later.
### The code is far from cleaned, we'll check the code and re-commit.
